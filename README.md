## What is Öztürk's Compression?
Öztürk's Compression is a compression model which adapts a large-sized file to the purpose of an archive.
This is an open source project.
More details are on [the wiki](https://github.com/CadmiumC48/ozturks-compression/wiki).

Please ignore the files in [ozturks-compression](https://github.com/CadmiumC48/ozturks-compression/tree/main/ozturks-compression) that are not written in C#.
They were added by the Git CLI and they are not related to compression.
(this is why Git is called "the stupid content tracker".)
